[GRIB2](http://pygrib2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Introduction_GRIB1-GRIB2.pdf) is the second version of the World Meterological Organization
(WMO) standard for distributing gridded data. This module includes a python
programmer interface for reading and writing GRIB2 grids as well as command-line utilites for listing and re-packing GRIB2 files.


This module is now deprecated - development has shifted to [pygrib](http://code.google.com/p/pygrib), which uses the ECMWF grib library and can read and write both GRIB1 and GRIB2.
